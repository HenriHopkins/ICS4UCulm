Monday:
-address player/team modes
-integrate timer class

-fully implement file writing method to record high scores

Tuesday:
-protect against incorrect input (prevent incorrect inputs from crashing the program)
-debugging
-look to improve overall effiency/extra work we can do
-if we're really ahead of schedule, GUI

Wednesday:
