Tuesday:
-protect against incorrect input (prevent incorrect inputs from crashing the program, henri has code for this from other projects)
-look to improve overall effiency/extra work we can do
-address player/team modes (possibly scrap that)
-figure out how to get timer class to loop correctly (need it to not loop at same time, might be possible with integration tho Henri will investigate this)
-fully implement file writing method to record high scores
-implement back buttons in psuedo-sub-methods (possibly by dividing them up into real sub-methods)

Wednesday:
-debugging (exit button after exiting info menu for instance)
-Henri does last checks
-if we're really ahead of schedule, GUI

Thursday:
-We present in person (?)
-Court can check it over too and submit

Friday:
-virtual presentation?
